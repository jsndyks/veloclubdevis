### BACK

VIS word is too big on the race cut long sleeved (which says ‘short sleeve” on the mockup but is long sleeved).
Compare with the actual short sleeved where you can see the red spikes at the top and see the previous version. I’d like that much of the spiky VIS word to show if possible, so we can see the red!

Here's how I like it in terms of size!

Here's the _short sleeve_, which looks good.

Here's the _long sleeve_, which looks wrong! Too big!

### CAP

**Wow - great!**

Any chance of getting NO21LA on the back of the cap and the spiky VIS word/ logo on the underside of the peak?

Here’s the spiky VIS word logo.

Go as crazy as you can!
Maybe get the hashtags on there?
Top of peak?


### SLEEVES

Hmmm … not great.
Lightweight sleeves would be much better if there was more clearer warped grid.
Any chance they can be more like the actual sleeves?
I like that hard cut-off.

Maybe there is room for a big VIS logo at the top of the arm too?

See above for the logo.

Ideally I would like the squares on the warped checker boards to be about the same size on sleeves, pockets and sides.

This is quite hard to get right, but do your best!

### Collar

I have attempted to fit everything inside the red lines as shown here :

I'd line the fold to go along the dotted line and between the two pieces of text, so that the text is in the middle of the collar on both sides (inside and outside, so not near to the fold at the top or the join with the jersey at the bottom - _central!_).

Here is the file - right click to download (probably)

### Sides

#### Left!

So this is the _cyclists'_ left!
So when in tuck the words will be readable.

Feel free to lose some of the stuff at the edges, but get the squares and logo to show in the red zone (we need these to be seen on all jerseys of all sizes).

### Sleeves

I want the designs on each sleeve to be the opposite one to the one on the side!

Feel free to lose some of the stuff at the edges, but get the squares and logo to show in the red zone and on one side of the sleeve.

Ideally I would like the logo and squares of text to be below the elbow.

I don't have a template for sleeves and so am guessing on sizes and dimensions here!

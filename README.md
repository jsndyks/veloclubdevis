#### ORIGINAL MESSAGE 220809

Hi James / PRIMAL - here is the artwork for the 2022 **Vélo Club de VIS** jersey design.

I am providing PDFs, which should give you the **vectors** - **please confirm that youre design folks can access the vectors!**

In most cases the PRIMAL patterns are contained within the PDFs to show how things should fit, but you will need to do some work to get this right!
You can see the PRIMAL patterns under some of the designs (hopefully you'll see the layters in the PDFs?). 

I have not added a long sleeved jersey - you will need to stick the separate sleeves to the shoulders!

Please send any questions or requests to **my mobile** as I am on vacation and not checking email.

Hope this is a good start.

J.

### FONTS

Oh, you'll likely need the fonts!

 * [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif)
 * [Scratchies](https://www.dafont.com/scratchies.font)
 * [MADE outer sans](https://www.dafont.com/made-outer-sans.font)
 * Helvetica Neue - _I am guessing you have this?_

### FRONT

We have a rectangular design that you'll probably recognise.

<img width="80%" src="2022/2022exportPDF/png/velo club jersey 2022.v3.FRONT.png"/>

Obviously it's heavily based on this, but perhaps less obviously, but I have added a bit of a twist with the recursion.

<img width="300" src="2022/laVieClairJersey.leMond.hampsten.jpeg"/>


The problem with the rectangle is that I want it to fit fully on all jerseys, but they are evidently different sizes.

Also, your patterns mean that the top of the design may get a bit lost in the sleeves (which touch the collar, unlike in the original where the sleeves start at the shoulders!)

So you may have to do something like this:<br/>
<img width="300" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0844/4811/products/LaVieClaire-Angle_1024x1024.jpg"/>

Rather than this:<br/>
<img width="300" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1380/4501/products/2018-06-18-santini-la-vie-claire-wonder-look-retro-cycling-jersey-0_2000x.jpg"/>

The first one doesn't look as good as the original, but do what you can!

The most important things are that ...

 * **the red rectangle reaches the sleeve join at the top**
 * **the VéLOOK text does not go past the zipper - like the original - it needs to be where _radar_ is on the jerseys shown above** 

You will need to figure out the scaling from that.

Also, I don't really want the blue and white rectangles at the side to be visible at all, but they may need to be for larger sizes.
These are just colours that can be used around the edges to fit in with the side colours (see later). Look at Hampsten and LeMond - they have tiny thin bits of blue and white at the edges of the rectangle to fill the space - so this is your wiggle room!

Try to fit the central column (grey, white, red, yellow) to fill as much of the jersey as possible.

Only rescale in ways that maintain aspect ratios and all relative text sizes and line widths.
<br/>Thanks!

### COLLAR

I have attempted to fit everything inside the red lines on the pattern but you may have to rescale or reposition a little :

### SIDE PANELS

#### ORIGINAL

Feel free to lose some of the stuff at the edges, but get the squares and logo to show in the red zone on the pattern (we need these to be seen on all jerseys of all sizes).

#### UPDATE

I found this, and realised that the upturned _Citroën_ logo is a pair of Vs for **Velo Club de VIS**!

<img width="300" src="2022/laVieClair.SHORTS.jpeg"/>

So I need to add these. 

Can we change the side panels to include this design?

[velo club jersey 2022.v3.SIDE.v2.pdf](2022/2022exportPDF/velo%20club%20jersey%202022.v3.SIDE.v2.pdf)

I'd like all of the rectangles to fit in the red zone, so you'll need to extent the background colour.



### SLEEVES


I don't have a template for sleeves and so am guessing on sizes and dimensions here!

The designs are really for separate sleeves, but I hope you can make long sleeved jerseys by just adding these designs to the shoulder patterns!
Keep the black cuff on the upper arm of the long sleeved jerseys (just add these arem designs to the end).

Scale the cuff and text so that the text is just about readable - text covers 60% of the circumference of the arm at the wrist.
Long sleeved cuff height should be the same as the short sleeved cuff height that is at the top of the arm.

<img width="80%" src="2022/2022exportPDF/png/velo club jersey 2022.v3.ARMS.png"/>

[velo club jersey 2022.v3.ARMS.pdf](2022/2022exportPDF/velo%20club%20jersey%202022.v3.ARMS.pdf)


### SLEEVE

These are for the shoulders and the tops of the long sleeved sleeves.

<img width="80%" src="2022/2022exportPDF/png/velo club jersey 2022.v3.SLEEVE.png"/>

[velo club jersey 2022.v3.SLEEVE.pdf](2022/2022exportPDF/velo%20club%20jersey%202022.v3.SLEEVE.pdf)

The **KITWARE** logo should show at the front when riding.

The coloured bars on the cuff should be about square to the arm (on the side).

The text at top should run along the top of the shoulder!

You may need to move things!


### BACK

The back looks like this!

<img width="80%" src="2022/2022exportPDF/png/velo club jersey 2022.v3.BACK.v4.png"/>

[velo club jersey 2022.v3.BACK.v4.pdf](2022/2022exportPDF/velo%20club%20jersey%202022.v3.BACK.v4.pdf)

I want the two patterns to be as big as possible - it's OK if we lose a bit on the smallest jersey sizes, so I have fitted them to the black size line (medium?).

I hope that the top of the pattern on the pocket can be below the seam stitching.

The three pieces of coloured text need to be above the pocket.

### SHORTS

Can you do anything with this?

Click below for the PDF - it would be great to see a mockup!
